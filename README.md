# Hangman_and_Guillotine
"Hangman" and "Guillotine" are classic games in which the player has to guess the letters in a guessed word. For each incorrectly guessed letter, an additional part of the gallows (or guillotine) is drawn, which will gradually be completed if the player fails to guess the word.
